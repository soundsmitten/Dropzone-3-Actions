# Dropzone-3-Actions
Properly Un-sandboxed and Awesome (for my own use)

![menubar](./menubar.png)

These actions allow me to have the cleanest menu bar ever via [Bartender](http://macbartender.com).

## Prerequisites 

- PyObjC (for Thumbtack action)
- Python 3 (you can get via Homebrew)
- Use the Soundsmitten syntax for Kirby's Baseblog (for blogprocessor)
- Being a nerd

## Thumbtack
- Drag a webloc file from your browser location bar into this action. I wrote this because some browsers (non-Safari) do not support the Thumbtack share item.

## Dropshare 4
- drag a file to upload it.

## Blog Processor
- This is the new generation of my [blog processor](https://github.com/soundsmitten/blogprocessor). It contains a Swift executable, of which I probably won't release the source because it is total spaghetti. The difference between this and the old nodejs is that it processes a textbundle file into a Kirby Baseblog post. It doesn't support all Baseblog features and probably never will, because I don't need them. All in all, it's only helpful for me.
