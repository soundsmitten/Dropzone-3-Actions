# Dropzone-3-Actions
Properly Un-sandboxed and Awesome (for my own use)

These actions allow me to have the cleanest menu bar ever via [Bartender](http://macbartender.com).

## Prerequisites 

- PyObjC (for Pushpin action)
- Python 3 (you can get via Homebrew)
- Use the Soundsmitten syntax for Kirby's Baseblog's (for blogprocessor)
- Being a nerd

## Pushpin
- Drag a webloc file from your browser location bar into this action.

## Dropshare 4
- drag a file to upload it.

## Blog Processor
- process a textbundle file into a Kirby Baseblog post. It doesn't support all Baseblog features and probably never will, because I don't need them.
